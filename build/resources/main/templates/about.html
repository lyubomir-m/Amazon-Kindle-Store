                    2022. The e-commerce platform is the 14th most visited website in the world.</p>

                <p>Results generated by Amazon's search engine are partly determined by promotional fees. The company's
                    localized
                    storefronts, which differ in selection and prices, are differentiated by top-level domain and
                    country code.</p>

                    e-readers, Fire and Fire HD color LCD tablets. Audible provides audiobooks for purchase and
                    listening.</p>

                <p>In September 2021, Amazon announced the launch of Astro, its first household robot, powered by its
                    Alexa smart
                    home
                    technology. This can be remote-controlled when not at home, to check on pets, people, or home
                    security. It will
                    send
                    owners a notification if it detects something unusual.</p>

                <p>In January 2023, Amazon announced the launch of RXPass, a prescription drug delivery service. It
                    allows U.S.
                    Amazon
                    Prime members to pay a $5 monthly fee for access to 60 medications. The service was launched
                    immediately after
                    the
                    announcement except in states with specific prescription delivery requirements. Beneficiaries of
                    government
                    healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid will not be able to sign up for RXPass.</p>
